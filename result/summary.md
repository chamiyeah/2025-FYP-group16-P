## Overview
This project focuses on preprocessing skin lesion images by detecting and removing hair to improve cancer classification accuracy. The provided Python script performs the following steps:
- Image Loading: Reads an input image in both RGB and grayscale formats.
- Hair Detection & Removal: Applies a morphological blackhat filter to detect hair, thresholds the result to create a binary mask, and removes hair artifacts using inpainting.
- Visualization: Displays the original image, blackhat-transformed image, thresholded mask, and final inpainted image.
- Output Storage: Saves the processed image for further analysis.
By ensuring hair-free lesion images, this preprocessing step enhances the accuracy of feature extraction and melanoma classification in subsequent stages of the project.
